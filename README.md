# C2Compiler - Native version

This is the C2 compiler written in C2 itself.

C2 is an evolution of C, please see http://c2lang.org for more info.

The first version was written in C++ and can be found in the history of
this archive too.


## Installation

see the [installation document](INSTALL.md) for installation on Linux or OSX.

## Libraries

*c2c* needs 2 environment variables:

- *C2_LIBDIR* - where to find the library headers
- *C2_PLUGINDIR* - where to find the compiled c2c plugins

The *C2_LIBDIR* should point to <path_to_c2compiler>/libs
The *C2_PLUGINDIR* may be anywhere and is used by the install_plugins.sh script


## Bootstrap

Since *c2c* is written in C2, a bootstrap is needed. Please run

```bash
. ./env.sh
make -C bootstrap
./install_plugins.sh
```

This will create a boostrap c2c version and use it to build the c2c compiler.
The output will be in the folder output/

Now you can run the regular C2 compiler to compile (other) C2 projects

```bash
./output/c2c/c2c
```

A nicer way would be to create a symlink in ~/bin:
```bash
ln -s <path_to_c2compiler>/output/c2c/c2c ~/bin/c2c
```

Also make sure ~/bin is in your PATH variable

### Plugins
The C2 compiler has a _plugin_ system, that allows plugins to be loaded during
compilation and the AST to be modified by them.

*c2c* will look for plugins in the environment variable $C2_PLUGINDIR (set by the
env.sh script). Also the path can be set in the _build-file_. To install the plugins
initially, run *./install_plugins.sh*. This will create ~/c2_plugins/ and copy all
plugins there.

To run *c2c* without plugins, use _--noplugins_.


### Tests

To run the unit tests run

```bash
./output/tester/tester test
```
